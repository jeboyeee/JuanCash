            <p class="fw-bold">VIRTUAL CURRENCIES</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Zybi Tech, the Platform, and Services support the trading of digital currencies according to instructions from Customers. Submitted virtual currency transactions must undergo confirmation by the virtual currency network and as such, will remain in an unconfirmed status until such time that the Platform is able to ensure the transaction's completion. Assets of funds related to a pending virtual currency transaction will be put on hold accordingly.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Fees</p>
            <p>Zybi Tech and the Platform may charge fees related to the processing of digital currency transactions on the Customer's behalf. The amount will be confirmed with the customer before the transaction, and the Customer will have to accept before the transaction is executed.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Trade suspension</p>
            <p>If Zybi Tech determines an onset of abnormally disadvantageous trades (to the Company or the Customer), Zybi Tech may suspend virtual currency exchange operations without giving prior notice. The suspension may last until Zybi Tech determines that the underlying indicators have returned to normalcy.
                Zybi Tech reserves the right to reverse or cancel transactions completed during the abnormal trading event.
                Zybi Tech is also not liable for any opportunity losses that the Customer may incur during suspension of trading.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Risks</p>
            <p>The following sections describe risks associated with (but not unique to) virtual currency use and trading. Zybi Tech bears no responsibility for protecting the customer against these risks.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Price volatility</p>
            <p>The Customer must be aware that the prices of virtual currencies may surge or drop precipitously at any time. This may be affected by factors such as (but not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing supply and demand</li>
                <li>Political events</li>
                <li>Economic events</li>
                <li>Wars</li>
                <li>Disasters</li>
                <li>Changes to regulations governing the virtual currency market</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fw-bold">Compromised accounts, passwords, or keys</p>
            <P>Virtual currency wallets have public and private keys, both consisting of symbols and characters. The public key can be shared with other users, it allows the user to receive cryptocurrencies into his or her digital wallet.
                Private keys, on the other hand, must always be safeguarded. If a private key is lost, the user will not be able to withdraw from his own account. If a private key is compromised, unauthorized actors can gain control or steal the contents of the virtual currency wallet.
                While Zybi Tech has support processes that can assist a Customer in gaining back control of compromised assets, Zybi Tech is not liable for any loses caused by compromised accounts, passwords, or keys.</P>

            <p>Zybi Tech may not detect all exploitable bugs in the programming of the Platform, and may also, due to normal course of application design and development, introduce flaws in programming that can be exploited by malicious actors or other Customers. Said bugs and flaws can result in customer data breaches and loss of digital assets.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Network or security breach</p>
            <p>Zybi Tech may suffer malicious breaches and cyberattacks that could result in the Customer's identity data and digital assets being stolen.</p>
